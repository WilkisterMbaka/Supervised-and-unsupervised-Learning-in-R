# Supervised-and-unsupervised-Learning-in-R

## Part I - Supervised Learning
### **Description**
A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process. She would now like to employ my services as a Data Science Consultant to create a supervised learning model to identify which individuals are most likely to click on my client's ads on her blog.

**Research Question**
* To identify which individuals are most likely to click on her ads.
* To build a supervised machine learning model

## Part II - Unsupervised Learning
### **Description**
Kira Plastinina is a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups. My findings should help inform the team in formulating the marketing and sales strategies of the brand.

**Research Question**
